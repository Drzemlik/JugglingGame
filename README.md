# Goals Of The Project
I created this project with the main purpose of: 
* learning object programming in JavaScript 
* learning how to use Git and GitHub effectively
* practicing code refactoring and developing a project

# About The Project
The DrzemlikGame project is work-in-progress - while developing it, I will keep updating "To Be Done: Bugs and Issues" list below, hopefully with the words "**fixed** or "**implemented**".

# About The Game
Juggle as long as you can, time within which none of the balls fell is your score.


## Controls
A/D keys - Left/Right movement of the left hand
E key - throw a ball with the left hand

Left/Right Arrow - Left/Right movement of the right hand
Up Arrow - throw a ball with the left hand

## Web Browsers The Game Works On:
Opera and Firefox.
Working on other browsers has not been checked yet.


# To Be Done Lists: Bugs And Issues

## Game Mechanics
1. the clock does not react/reset on a ball falling to the ground = no scoring

2. clock should be larger and located closer to the canvas

3. no highscores

4. balls do not stay in a hand while crossing hands

5. after throwing balls turn in the air after a hand starts to move in the opposite direction

6. throwing two/three balls from one hand is doable, but needs improvement; objective here: each ball thrown only on stroking E/UpArr keys and for left/right hand respectively

7. balls collide with one another only horizontally, vertical collisions are to be added


## Code Quality
* CQ1 no classes/constructors used in order to make the code more efficient
* CQ2 more logically named functions needed
